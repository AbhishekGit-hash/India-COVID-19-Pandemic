# Smart Agent Recruitment

## Overview
FinMan is a Financial Distribution company. They sell Financial products to consumers by hiring agents in their network. These agents are freelancers and get commission when they make a product sale. The Managers at FinMan are primarily responsible for recruiting agents. Once a manager has identified a potential applicant, the would explain the business opportunity to the agent. Once the agent provides the consent, an application is made to FinMan to become an agent. This date is known as application_receipt_date. In the next 3 months, this potential agent has to undergo a 7 day training at the FinMan branch (about Sales processes and various products) and clear a subsequent examination in order to become a FinMan agent.

## Goal of the project
The purpose of this project is to create a predictive model to identify the best agents / applicants who will be able to source business for FinMan within 3 months post the 7 day coorporate training. There is a significant investment which FinMan makes in identifying, training and recruiting these agents. However, there are a set of agents who do not bring in the expected resultant business. A <b>FinMan Agent Recruitment Dashboard</b> is developed using <b>Power BI</b> and the EDA, feature engineering and model devlopment is done using <b>Python</b>.
